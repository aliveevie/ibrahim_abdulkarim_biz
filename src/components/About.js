          <p>
            I am Ibrahim, a highly responsive, resilient, and exceptionally
            patient backend engineer with more than three years of invaluable
            learning and practical experience in the field of web development.
            My journey has been enriched through various educational endeavors,
            including comprehensive courses on FreeCodeCamp, which have
            significantly augmented my comprehension and proficiency in both
            front-end and back-end technologies.
